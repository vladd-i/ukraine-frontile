# Life on the Frontline: People's Access to Services Amidst an Armed Conflict in Eastern Ukraine

In this project, I explore people's access to services amidst a military conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine. 
Using R and R Shiny, I analyze and visualize how the satisfaction with basic services affects trust in the local government
among people who live along the frontline of the military confrontation. Finally, I identify areas with most 
needs to inform better humanitarian response in the region. Final Project for Harvard's Gov 50: Data, Fall 2020.
